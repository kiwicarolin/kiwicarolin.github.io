Trails revolves around the visualisation and navigation of graphs in Virtual Reality that represent a social network. This was resolved using a combination of hand gestures and gaze on the Oculus Rift DK2 with a Magic Leap. A world-in-miniature style map shows an overview of the graph and can be used to quickly navigate through large sections. Smaller parts can be selected to view in detail, which allows the inspection of individual nodes and their connections.
