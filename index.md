## Building the future of AR/VR 

 I believe the future of AR/VR is built on finding answers to meaningful questions that identify the benefits of AR/VR to create products with impact. 
 
 When I first encountered AR the ability to combine digital and real experinces captivated me – And I decided I wanted to be at the forefront of this exciting technology with a huge potential impact on society and the way it brings people closer together. 
 
 I specialise in finding innovative ways to use emerging technologies to solve current problems and how they could have a real impact on people. My goal is to explore future AR/VR applications that delight and inspire in entirely new problem spaces. Recently, I have also co-founded a company dedicated to creating meaningful AR/VR experiences [Nisus Development](https://www.nisus.dev/).
