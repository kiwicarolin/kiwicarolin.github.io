## Building the future of AR/VR 

Ever since encountering AR for the first time, I knew I wanted to be at the forefront of this exciting technology that has such a tremendous potential on shaping new digital experiences and offering new ways to bring people closer together. I believe the future of these technologies is built on understanding how people use new technology and finding answers to meaningful questions that identify the benefits of AR/VR for impactful experiences.
 
 My goal is to explore future AR/VR applications that delight and inspire in meaningful problem spaces to unlock new ways of working and connection for everyone.
