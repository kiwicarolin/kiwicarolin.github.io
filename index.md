## Building the future of AR/VR 

 The future of AR/VR is built on finding the answers to meaningful questions that identify the benefits of AR/VR and apply them to products that empower its users. I specialise in finding innovative ways to use emerging technologies to solve current problems and how they could have a real impact on people. My goal is to explore future AR/VR applications that delight and inspire in entirely new problem spaces.
