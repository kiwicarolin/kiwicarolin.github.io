## Virtual Reality for high impact use cases 

* Exploring interactive reconstructed crime scenes in Virtual Reality for better understanding of the events that transpired
* Investigating the impact of Virtual Reality on decision-making, attention and memory in a reconstructed scene following a narrative 
* Improving presentation of forensic evidence for better understanding by the Jury
* Establishing guidelines for future use of Virtual Reality in court

_My research is possible thanks to the Data to Decisions CRC who graciously support my candidature._
