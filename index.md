## Ongoing Research

* Exploring interactive reconstructed crime scenes in Virtual Reality for a better user experience 
* Investigating the impact of Virtual Reality on decision-making, attention and memory in a reconstructed scene following a narrative 
* Improving presentation of forensic evidence for better understanding by the jury

_My research is possible thanks to the Data to Decisions CRC who have graciously supported me throughout the past two years._
