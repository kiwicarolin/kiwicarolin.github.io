## Building the future of AR/VR 

Ever since encountering AR for the first time, I decided I wanted to be at the forefront of this exciting technology with a huge potential impact on society and the way it brings people closer together. I believe the future of AR/VR is built on finding answers to meaningful questions that identify the benefits of AR/VR to create products with impact. 
 
 My goal is to explore future AR/VR applications that delight and inspire in entirely new problem spaces. Recently, I have also co-founded a company dedicated to creating meaningful AR/VR experiences [Nisus Development](https://www.nisus.dev/).

## Key Skills 

* Create impactful AR/VR applications for a new outlook on how we view the future  
* Prototype ideas, experiences and scenarios in the intersection of science, design and development
* Extensive experience in generating high quality 3D reconstruction 
* Assessing the cognitive impact of AR/VR in collaborative and single user settings 
* Passionate about radically improving how we interact with new technology 
* Use design thinking approaches to solve problems creatively in completely new landscapes
* Generate user insights through user research using mixed methods and interpreting its data 
* Effective collaborator with different professions to work successfully towards a common goal

## AR/VR Experience

 I specialise in finding innovative ways to use emerging technologies to solve current problems and how they could have a real impact on people – with a particular love for everything 3D reconstruction. I've got extensive experience in the reconstruction of objects and environments with a variety of techniques (photogrammetry/LiDAR/3D cameras). I am particularly interested in industrial applications and how it affects human cognition of users in immersive environments.

 I'm also an expert in building immersive user experiences and help establish new fundamentals in how we interact in AR/VR. I'm currently focusing on how to best combine smartphones and AR head-mounted displays to provide a delightful experience that goes beyond the touch screen.
