## Past and Ongoing Work

### ShopTrotter: Loyalty program for shopping malls 
_Tools: Unity, Mapbox and QGis_

Precision Group, owner of several shopping centres across Australia, was looking for an innovative idea to increase dwelling time in their centres. 
ShopTrotter lets people earn rewards the more time they spend exploring the centre. 

Implementation of the feature into the app will commence in November and roll out for all shopping centres early next year.

The app features an indoor map with points of interests that support the visitor to reach their goals.
