## Past and Ongoing Work

### Virtual Reality for Crime Scene Visualisation [PhD]
_Tools: Unity, HTC Vive, FARO Laser scanner, point cloud visualisation tools [User research, design and development]_

Reconstructing the event of a serious crime can be a major challenge for the jury. During my initial interviews with prosecution and defence attorneys, they highlighted the importance of a jury being able to experience the scene. The court is willing to take on significant expenses to provide jurors a site viewing, despite the fact that this could be months or years after the crime occurred with a scene that may have changed drastically. But what if the viewer could see the original scene just as it was? I wondered if VR could provide the perfect opportunity to improve a potentially life-altering process.

Participants viewed a fictional hit and run scenario and had to memorise items found at the scene and make a verdict.

Can VR support attention and understanding of forensic information that has a spatial component? As the user is listening to an expert statement, the environment is going to highlight the areas they should be paying attention to. 

### ShopTrotter: Loyalty Program for Shopping Malls 
_Tools: Unity, Mapbox and QGis [Design and contributing developer]_

Precision Group, owner of several shopping centres across Australia, was looking for an innovative idea to increase dwelling time in their centres.

Implementation of the feature into the app will commence in November and roll out for all shopping centres early next year.
