## Past and Ongoing Work

### UI Insights from cross-device AR interfaces

Designed and led a UX feasibility study using SecondSight, a modular prototyping tool I co-developed for testing AR interfaces across smartphones and optical see-through head-mounted displays. Conducted usability studies with both quantitative metrics and qualitative interviews to evaluate spatial content placement under varying AR headset Field of Views. Collaborated with engineers to build a flexible, open-source platform that supports rapid iteration on multi-modal input (touch, gesture, head-pose). The project produced early design insights and a reusable tool for future AR UX research.

### Evaluating VR for the justice system 

Virtual Reality has the unique capability to provide the illusion of being somewhere else â€“ And feel like _being there_. Could this potentially help a jury to better understand how a crime transpired during a trial? 

I conducted end-to-end user research and development of a VR system to assess it for courtroom use. Applied mixed methods including recall tasks, interviews, usability surveys, and physiological measures to assess cognition and decision-making. Findings showed VR improved spatial memory, attention, and verdict consistency, demonstrating its value for high-stakes decision-making environments. The better the scene and the event is understood by the jury, the more likely it is to have a really good outcome in court with the right answers obtained. My thesis provided evidence that VR is a promising tool to help jury members better memorise and understand what happened.

### Depth perception for architectural and urban planning projects in AR 

Led a UX research project in collaboration with industry partners in the real estate sector to explore the feasibility of enhancing mobile AR efficiency. Designed and conducted a mixed-methods study examining the impact of visual depth cues on distance perception. Findings highlighted a disconnect between user preference and performance. These initial insights highlight key considerations for optimising AR design in architectural and urban planning contexts.

### Connecting people remotely with wearables 

Designed and ran a mixed-methods UX study to evaluate interaction models for _Social Panoramas_, a cross-device system between a wearable device (Google Glass) and tablet users that enables people to connect in real-time to share their experiences remotely. Evaluated social presence and interaction modes using usability metrics and qualitative feedback. Insights informed design principles for future AR/VR collaboration tools.

### Assessing quality of lifelike reconstructions

A main expertise of mine is assessing the quality and impact of lifelike 3D reconstructions of avatars and environments on the user experience in VR, including photogrammetry, point clouds, meshes, and Gaussian Splats.
